# Joyful Tao

Joyful Tao is a project of translating the acient Chinese philosophical classic "TaoTeching" into English by Joy Yan. Joy loves philosophy and science. TaoTeching seems to depict the essential principles of our universe and resonate well with the most advanced scientific research fields such as quantum physics and artificial intelligence. Thus, Joy thinks, it would be a great idea to start this project in order to help herself and others to understand Tao Te Ching, which could be inspiring to their scientific research work.

As Joy received enlightments from Tao, she experienced great pleasures from innerself. Thus, this little translation work would be named as Joyful Tao. You are certainly welcome to contact her if you are interested in Tao Te Ching.
