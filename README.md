Joyful Tao is a project of translating the acient Chinese philosophical classic "TaoTeching" into English by Joy Yan. Joy loves philosophy and science. TaoTeching seems to depict the essential principles of our universe and resonate well with the most advanced scientific researchs such as quantum physics and computer science. Thus, Joy thinks, it would be a great idea to start this project in order to help herself and others to learn Tao Te Ching, which could be inspiring to her scientific researchs.
