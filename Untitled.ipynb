    "Tao is the essence of all the universal principles. It governs our universe. We can try to describe some principles behind a specific phenomenon regarding its time and space. However, we can not describe the essence of the whole universe in this way since the universe is so vast and the principles found by our humanbings are so limited by their existing conditions. For instance, Newton's Three Laws of mechanics appear to be very useful in our daily life, yet fail in the extremely micro or macro universes. \n",
